## Asher Leggett

SQL, short for structured query language is a programming language intended for sorting, creating and reading data sets. 

Important things about SQL:

1. It is an ANSI/ISO certified language, making it widely used and extremely applicable
2. Complicated/large sets of data can be easily sorted/searched with SQL
3 Easy to learn due to structure/syntax of language, and there are many free resources to learn it
4. Has variations of the language through different companies/organizations, e.g. T-SQL from Microsoft
